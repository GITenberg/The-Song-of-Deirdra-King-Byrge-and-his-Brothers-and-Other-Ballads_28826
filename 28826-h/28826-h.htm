5</span>THE SONG OF DEIRDRA</h2>
<p>Farewell, grey Albyn, much loved land,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I ne&rsquo;er shall see thy hills again;<br />
Upon those hills I oft would stand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And view the chase sweep o&rsquo;er the plain.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas pleasant from their tops I ween<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To see the stag that bounding ran;<br />
And all the rout of hunters keen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sons of Usna in the van.</p>
<p>The chiefs of Albyn feasted high,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Amidst them Usna&rsquo;s children shone;<br />
And Nasa kissed in secrecy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The daughter fair of high Dundron.</p>
<p><!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>To her a milk-white doe he sent,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With little fawn that frisked and played<br />
And once to visit her he went,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As home from Inverness he strayed.</p>
<p>The news was scarcely brought to me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When jealous rage inflamed my mind;<br />
I took my boat and rushed to sea,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For death, for speedy death, inclined.</p>
<p>But swiftly swimming at my stern<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Came Ainlie bold and Ardan tall;<br />
Those faithful striplings made me turn<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And brought me back to Nasa&rsquo;s hall.</p>
<p>Then thrice he swore upon his arms,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His burnished arms, the foeman&rsquo;s bane,<br />
That he would never wake alarms<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In this fond breast of mine again.</p>
<p>Dundron&rsquo;s fair daughter also swore,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And called to witness earth and sky,<br />
That since his love for her was o&rsquo;er<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A maiden she would live and die.</p>
<p><!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>Ah did she know that slain in fight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He wets with gore the Irish hill,<br />
How great would be her moan this night,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But greater far would mine be still.</p>

8</span>THE DIVER<br />
<span class="smcap">a ballad translated from the
german</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the man who will dive for his King,<br />
In the pool as it rushes with turbulent sweep?<br />
A cup from this surf-beaten jetty I fling,<br />
And he who will seek it below in the deep,<br />
And will bring it again to the light of the day,<br />
As the meed of his valour shall bear it away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now courage, my knights, and my warriors bold,<br />
For, one, two, and three, and away it shall go&mdash;&rdquo;<br
/>
He toss&rsquo;d, as he said it, the goblet of gold<br />
Deep, deep in the howling abysses below.&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;Where is the hero who ventures to brave<br />
The whirl of the pool, and the break of the wave?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>The steel-coated lancemen, and nobles around,<br />
Spoke not, but they trembled in silent surprise,<br />
And pale they all stood on the cliff&rsquo;s giddy bound,<br />
And no one would venture to dive for the prize.<br />
&ldquo;Three times have I spoke, but no hero will spring<br />
And dive for the goblet, and dive for the King.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But still they were silent and pale as before,<br />
Till a brave son of Eirin, in venturous pride,<br />
Dash&rsquo;d forth from the lancemen&rsquo;s trembling corps<br
/>
And canted his helm, cast his mantle aside,<br />
While spearman, and noble, and lady, and knight,<br />
Gazed on the bold stripling in breathless affright.</p>
<p>Unmoved by the thoughts of his horrible doom,<br />
He mounted the cliff&mdash;and he paus&rsquo;d on his leap,<br />
For the waves which the pool had imbibed in its womb<br />
Were spouted in thunder again from the deep,&mdash;<br />
Yes! as they return&rsquo;d, their report was as loud<br />
As the peal when it bursts from the storm-riven cloud.</p>
<p><!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>It roared, and it drizzled, it hiss&rsquo;d and it
whirl&rsquo;d,<br />
And it bubbled like water when mingled with flame,<br />
And columns of foam to the heaven were hurl&rsquo;d,<br />
And billow on billow tumultuously came;<br />
It seem&rsquo;d that the womb of the ocean would bear<br />
Sea over sea to the uppermost air.</p>
<p>It thundered again as the wave gathered slow,<br />
And black from the drizzling foam as it fell,<br />
The mouth of the fathomless tunnel below<br />
Was seen like the pass to the regions of hell;<br />
The waters roll round it, and gather and boom,<br />
And then all at once disappear in the gloom.</p>
<p>And now ere the waves had returned from the deep,<br />
The youth wiped the sweat-drops which hung on his brows,<br />
And he plunged&mdash;and the cataracts over him sweep,<br />
And a shout from his terrified comrades arose;<br />
And then there succeeded a horrible pause<br />
For the whirlpool had clos&rsquo;d its mysterious jaws.</p>
<p><!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>And stiller it grew on the watery waste,<br />
In the womb of the ocean it bellow&rsquo;d alone,<br />
The knights said their Aves in terrified haste,<br />
And crowded each pinnacle, jetty, and stone:<br />
&ldquo;The high-hearted stripling is whelm&rsquo;d in the
tide,<br />
Ah! wail him,&rdquo; was echoed from every side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the monarch had buried his crown in the pool<br />
And said: &lsquo;He shall wear it who brings it again,&rsquo;<br
/>
I would not have been so insensate a fool<br />
As to dive when all hope of returning were vain;<br />
What heaven conceals in the gulfs of the deep,<br />
Lies buried for ever, and there it must sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Full many a burden the whirlpool had borne,<br />
And spouted it forth on the drizzling surge,<br />
But nought but a mast that was splinter&rsquo;d and torn,<br />
Or the hull of a vessel was seen to emerge;<br />
But wider and wider it opens its jaws,<br />
And louder it gurgles, and louder it draws.</p>
<p><!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>It drizzled, it thunder&rsquo;d, it hiss&rsquo;d and it
whirl&rsquo;d,<br />
And it bubbled like water when mingled with flame,<br />
And columns of foam to the heaven were hurl&rsquo;d,<br />
And flood upon flood from the deep tunnel came;<br />
And then with a noise like the storm from the North,<br />
The hellish eruption was vomited forth.</p>
<p>But, ah! what is that on the wave&rsquo;s foamy brim,<br />
Disgorged with an ocean of wreck and of wood?<br />
&rsquo;Tis the snow-white arm and the shoulder of him<br />
Who daringly dived for the glittering meed:<br />
&rsquo;Tis he, &rsquo;tis the stripling so hardy and bold,<br />
Who swings in his left hand the goblet of gold.</p>
<p>He draws a long breath as the breaker he leaves,<br />
Then swims through the water with many a strain,<br />
While all his companions exultingly heave<br />
Their voices above the wild din of the main:<br />
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis he, O! &rsquo;tis he, from the horrible hole<br
/>
The brave one has rescued his body and soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>He reach&rsquo;d the tall jetty, and kneeling he laid<br
/>
The massy gold goblet in triumph and pride<br />
At the foot of the monarch, who instantly made<br />
A sign to his daughter who stood by his side:<br />
She fill&rsquo;d it with wine, and the youth with a spring<br />
Received it, and quaff&rsquo;d it, and turn&rsquo;d to the
King.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long life to the monarch! how happy are they<br />
Who breathe and exist in the sun&rsquo;s rosy light,<br />
But he who is doom&rsquo;d in the ocean to stray,<br />
Views nothing around him but horror and night;<br />
Let no one henceforward be tempted like me<br />
To pry in the secrets contain&rsquo;d in the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I felt myself seized, with the quickness of thought<br
/>
The whirlpool entomb&rsquo;d me in body and limb,<br />
And billow on billow tumultuously brought<br />
It&rsquo;s cataracts o&rsquo;er me; in vain did I swim,<br />
For like a mere pebble with horrible sound<br />
The force of the double stream twisted me round.</p>
<p><!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>&ldquo;But God in his mercy, for to him alone<br />
In the moment of danger I ever have clung,<br />
Did bear me towards a projection of stone:<br />
I seized it in transport, and round it I hung,<br />
The goblet lay too on a corally ledge,<br />
Which jutted just over the cataract&rsquo;s edge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then I look&rsquo;d downward, and horribly deep,<br
/>
And twinkling sheen in the darkness below,<br />
And though to the hearing it ever might sleep,<br />
Yet still the eye clouded with terror might know,<br />
That serpents and creatures that made my blood cool,<br />
Were swimming and splashing about in the pool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ball&rsquo;d up to a mass, in a moment
uncoil&rsquo;d,<br />
They rose, and again disappear&rsquo;d in the dark,<br />
And down in the billows which over them boil&rsquo;d<br />
I saw a behemoth contend with a shark;<br />
The sounds of their hideous duel awaken<br />
The black-bellied whale, and the slumbering craken.</p>
<p><!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>&ldquo;Still, still did I linger forlorn, and
oppress&rsquo;d<br />
With a feeling of terror that curdled my blood;<br />
Ah think of a human and sensible breast<br />
Enclosed with the hideous shapes of the flood;<br />
Still, still did I linger, but far from the reach<br />
Of those that I knew would await on the beach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Methought that a serpent towards me did creep,<br />
And trailing behind him whole fathoms of length,<br />
He open&rsquo;d his jaws; and I dropp&rsquo;d from the steep<br
/>
Round which I had clung with expiring strength:<br />
&rsquo;Twas well that I did so, the stream bore me up,<br />
And here is thy servant, and there is the cup.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then was retiring, a look from the King<br />
Detain&rsquo;d him: &ldquo;My hero, the cup is thine own,<br />
&rsquo;Tis richly thy meed, but I&rsquo;ll give thee this
ring,<br />
Beset with a diamond and chrysolite stone,<br />
If again thou wilt dive, and discover to me<br />
What&rsquo;s hid in the deepest abyss of the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>The daughter heard that with compassionate thought,<br
/>
Quick, quick to the feet of the monarch she flew:<br />
&ldquo;O father, desist from this horrible sport,<br />
He has done what no other would venture to do,<br />
If the life of a creature thou fain must destroy,<br />
Let a noble take place of this generous boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The monarch has taken the cup in his hand,<br />
And tumbled it down in the bellowing sea:<br />
&ldquo;And if thou canst bring it again to the strand,<br />
The first, and the best of my knights thou shalt be;<br />
If that will not tempt thee, this maid thou shalt wed,<br />
And share as a husband the joys of her bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the pride of old Eirin arose in his look,<br />
And it flash&rsquo;d from his eye-balls courageously keen,<br />
One glance on the beautiful vision he took,<br />
And he saw her change colour, and sink on the green.<br />
&ldquo;By the stool of Saint Peter the prize I&rsquo;ll
obtain;&rdquo;<br />
He shouted, and instantly dived in the main.</p>
<p><!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>The waters sunk down, and a thundering peal<br />
Announced that the time of their sojourn was o&rsquo;er;<br />
Each eye is cast downward in terrified zeal,<br />
As forth from the tunnel the cataracts pour.<br />
The waters rush up, and the waters subside;<br />
But ah! the bold diver remains in the tide.</p>
<h2><!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>KING BYRGE AND HIS BROTHERS</h2>
<p>Dame Ingeborg three brave brothers could boast,<br />
For the crown of Sweden their lives they lost.</p>
<p>The nobles to Sweden would fain away,<br />
Dame Ingeborg bade them at home to stay.</p>
<p>Dame Ingeborg stood at Helsingborg&rsquo;s gate,<br />
&ldquo;Dear brothers, go not, I beg and entreat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then with one voice the brothers cried:<br />
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve long for our realms paternal sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we have too long with thee remained,<br />
Our hearts within us are sorely pained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five days with me, dear brothers, wait,<br />
Whilst I my dreadful dream relate.</p>
<p><!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>&ldquo;Methought that your mantles were of lead,<br />
With them, dear brothers, ye were arrayed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were fast tied about your throats,<br />
And treachery towards ye that denotes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Dame Ingeborg&rsquo;s rede no ear they lent,<br />
But to Sweden that very same day they went.</p>
<p>And when they had won to the sand beach white,<br />
There met them Brouk, that faithless knight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye brothers both, thrice welcome be,<br />
Ye&rsquo;ll come and drink Yule with His Majesty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The nobles repair to Nykoping street,<br />
There they a deceitful counsel meet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now off your bodies your armour lay,<br />
And hie to the castle in court dress gay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In at the doorway the nobles stepped,<br />
Up to receive them the monarch leapt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear brothers both, thrice welcome be,<br />
Will ye drink Yule with our Majesty?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>With his brothers down sate King Byrge to food,<br />
Much serious discourse betwixt them ensued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now welcome, my brothers, thrice welcome I say,<br />
May I not alone the country sway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May God to our brother grant happiness,<br />
But he cannot alone the land to possess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The nobles they ate and they drank for a trice,<br />
Brouk has discovered another device:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will ye now do, ye worshipful knights,<br />
Have drinking and dancing for ye delights?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they danced out and danced in with glee,<br />
And Brouk the clear wine poured so free.</p>
<p>On the floor stood the nobles and &rsquo;gan to sing,<br />
Whilst Brouk proceeded to plot with the King.</p>
<p>Then unto his brother Duke Valdemar said:<br />
&ldquo;O Erik, we drink too much wine, I&rsquo;m afraid.</p>
<p><!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>&ldquo;Be we on our guard &rsquo;gainst Brouk&rsquo;s
pleasantries,<br />
He knoweth all manner of villanies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Duke Erik held up his good right hand:<br />
&ldquo;Shall we fear aught in our fatherland?</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are come with a safety assurance fair,<br />
And of no quarrel are we aware.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They drank and they danced till the day had ta&rsquo;en
flight,<br />
Then illumined was torch and big wax light.</p>
<p>To hie now to bed the nobles desired,<br />
And repose on the bolsters their bodies tired.</p>
<p>Then in to the prison tower they were led,<br />
The King himself went in his cloak of red.</p>
<p>They thought that in jest the thing was done,<br />
&rsquo;Till he slammed the doors to every one.</p>
<p>Manlike fought Erik and scorned to yield,<br />
As long as he&rsquo;d sword or a post to wield.</p>
<p><!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>Broke sword! broke post! they no more could defend!<br
/>
Into prison they naked were forced to wend.</p>
<p>The noble brothers suffered sore,<br />
From frost and from cold and from hunger much more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll give thee, Brouk, the gold so red,<br />
If thou&rsquo;lt give us but water and bread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye shall not obtain in Sweden here,<br />
Or bread or water your hearts to cheer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our dear brother&rsquo;s wife we are confident,<br />
To let us be starved will ne&rsquo;er consent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know the Queen has a pitying breast,<br />
She will straw send us whereon to rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hunger within us is sharp and strong,<br />
Our hearts must certainly burst ere long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Brouk at that word so wrathful grew,<br />
The keys he into the salt fiord threw.</p>
<p><!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>Twas dismal to hear how with hunger they roared,<br />
Each others shoulders they devoured.</p>
<p>And there is yet more woe to relate,<br />
The flesh from the sides of each other they ate.</p>
<p>Much misery and woe there was that tide,<br />
In each other&rsquo;s arms the brothers died.</p>
<p>And thus things stood till five months were fled,<br />
King Byrge came home from the war-field red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now whither departed are brothers mine?<br />
Why didst thou not give them their fill of wine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then answered straight the little child:<br />
&ldquo;Brouk into the tower the nobles beguiled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>King Byrge peeped in the window through,<br />
The state of the brothers was piteous to view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now hear thou, Brouk, straight to me declare,<br />
Where the prison keys are I gave to thy care?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>&ldquo;May the blessed Christ my soul ne&rsquo;er
save,<br />
If I cast them not in the briny wave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Brouk, shame fall thy head upon,<br />
So evilly towards me thou has done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou fool and villain!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve lost thereby<br
/>
The keys to Sweden&rsquo;s sovereignty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I have betrayed thy brothers twain,<br />
Thou mayest alone over Sweden reign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That deed such grief to the Dukes&rsquo; friends gave,<br />
And that grief they carried to the grave.</p>
<p>With his Queen King Byrge must fly from his throne,<br />
Beheaded was Magnus, his beautiful son.</p>
<p>But Brouk to the infamous wheel was consigned,<br />
May all such traitors a like end find!</p>
<p>When sovereigns many there are to a land,<br />
You&rsquo;ll never see them go hand in hand.</p>
<p><!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>The one &rsquo;fore the other must certainly fall,<br />
Not seldom destruction comes o&rsquo;er them all.</p>
<p>Though fraud and deceit for a time have success,<br />
At length on their owner they&rsquo;ll bring distress.</p>

26</span>TURKISH HYMN TO MAHOMET</h2>
<p>O envoy of Allah, to thee be salaam,<br />
With my whole heart I love thee, O blest be thy name.<br />
At the high throne of God thou for sinners dost plead<br />
Who forgives for thy sake each iniquitous deed.<br />
O Prophet of Allah, for all that I&rsquo;ve done<br />
Of rebellion against Him, tis thou must atone.<br />
For Thou art the one intercessor, Thou, Thou&mdash;<br />
The prince of the prophets to whom the rest bow.<br />
In the world&rsquo;s Judgment Day when all nations are met,<br />
When good deeds and bad in the balance are set,<br />
Intercession I hope for, from Thee, only Thee,<br />
So breathe intercession for me, wretched me.<br />
<!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>&rsquo;Tis true my misdeeds I&rsquo;m unable to
count,<br />
But I know that thy goodness exceeds their amount.<br />
Like one who&rsquo;s defunct I a long time have been,<br />
My body is drowned in an ocean of sin.<br />
My rebellions they be of so dreadful a die<br />
That to wend to my Maker no courage have I.<br />
Now save I in dust at thy feet myself throw,<br />
And thy footstool I strike with my agonis&rsquo;d brow;<br />
And save thou for me dost benignantly speak,<br />
What for me will remain but despairing to shriek?<br />
For unless I thy kind intercession procure,<br />
My soul with the Kaffirs will torments endure.<br />
But I trust thou wilt that for thy servant employ&rsquo;<br />
And that rest I shall gain, and unspeakable joy.<br />
Unto thee without end shall be praises and prayers,<br />
And also to them, thy disciples and heirs,<br />
The voyagers noble who trod the true road,<br />
And to others the path of salvation who show&rsquo;d,<br />
The four eldest friends of exalted degree<br />
Who of our religion the four pillars be.<br />

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://www.gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

copied or distributed:

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
